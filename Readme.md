## Our Philosophy

Our working philosophy is:

```
C  - Comply with standards => Always think about the standards and how to make the web semantic
A  - Arresting Design      => Standards compliant doesnt mean boring. We aim for beautiful designs 
F  - Forward Thinking      => We always think out of the box. We try to find ways to make things better for the client
```

## Features
