               <p>It&#8217;s January 2016, and HTML/CSS/JS are the front-end stack that makes up all web development. Current versions of each are generally well accepted, Mobile makes up around half of all web browsing, Microsoft has made a half decent browser and front-end web development is a solid job on it&#8217;s own!</p>

               <p> In COMP 1950, we&#8217;re going to take a look at that front-end stack, how 
                you can make those three technologies work together to make great 
                things. </p>   
                
                <p>During the first half of the course, we will take a hard look at HTML 
and CSS and where we are now as web developers. We will move 
on to template development (the primary task in web development 
these days) and mix in some JS later on.</p>
                 <p>This page will contain news or updates from time to time, so stay 
tuned.</p>
