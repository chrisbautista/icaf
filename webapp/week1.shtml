                <h3>Student Pages</h3>
                <p>Each student will get personal webspace. This is not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more. Make it a site that is usable and functional.</p>

                <p>Each student will be assigned web space for their homework and other files. All work performed on lab computers should be saved to personal files.</p>

                <p>Your instructor will create webspaces for each student at the end of the first lecture. Please be present for this, as you will be entering your own password.</p>
